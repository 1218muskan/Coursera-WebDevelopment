                    Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened 
                    wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, 
                    which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
                    A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

                    A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked 
                    patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, 
                    grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, 
                    bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation 
                    of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.

                    Hot chocolate, also known as hot cocoa or drinking chocolate, is a heated drink consisting of shaved 
                    chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate 
                    may be topped with whipped cream or marshmallows. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes 
                    called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.
